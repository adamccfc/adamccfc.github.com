### Hey, I'm Adam. I have a passion for the web.

I went to university in 2008 to study web design at the University of Western England, where I gained a 2:1 degree. Ever since going to University I have been developing websites, mainly during the working day. I am currently working as a front end web developer for [Eysys](http://www.eysys.com).

I like to build responsive websites that gives the user the best possible experience no matter what device they are viewing the website on. 

### Freelance Work

If you are looking for a freelance front end developer to work on an exiciting project with you, then please feel free to get in touch. You can tweet me [@adamtaffymorgan](https://twitter.com/adamtaffymorgan).

### During My Free Time

Football is another passion of mine. I'm an avid Cardiff City and Wales supporter. I've been going to watch Cardiff play since I was 13, and I've been a season ticket holder for the past 7 years. I've always gone to watch Wales play even when the numbers were dwindling (I'm quite patriotic). 

On the rare occasion I get a spare hour, I like to spend my time on my Xbox One. I play a number of types of games, ranging from FIFA to Elder Scrolls Online. If you'd like a game then add my gamertag - Adam CCFC. 

There's nothing I find more relaxing than cooking a meal. I take pleasure in cooking for others and then watching them devour what's in front of them.
