## I have been developing websites for 6 years

I went to university in 2008 to study web design at the University of Western England, where I gained a 2:1 degree. Ever since going to University I have been developing websites. 

I like to build responsive websites that gives the user the best possible experience no matter what device they are viewing the website on. 

If you would like to get in touch about me developing a website for you, then please contact me.

## During My Free Time

### Gaming

On the rare occasion I get a spare hour, I like to spend my time on my Xbox One. I mainly play Fifa, so if you'd like a game, add my gamertag - Adam CCFC.

### Cooking

There's nothing I find more relaxing than cooking a meal. I take pleasure in cooking for other people and watching them enjoy the meal that I have made.

### Football

I'm an avid Cardiff City supporter. I've been going to watch them play since I was 13, and I've been a season ticket holder for the past 7 year
