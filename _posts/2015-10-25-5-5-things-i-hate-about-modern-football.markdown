I'm not sure whether it's due to getting older, or whether I'm just more cynical, but there's a number of things that are starting to annoy me with today's 'modern' football.

After watching "Super Sunday" today, it has just further ignited my fury at the points I'm about to make. So let's not waste any more time and get into it.

##1. Football Is No Longer A Contact Sport

The first game that took place today was the Tyne-Wear derby. Sunderland vs Newcastle. A giant of a derby to take place in the north. Newcastle dominated the first half, all until the final minute of injury time where Coloccini went shoulder to shoulder with Fletcher. Coloccini was the stronger of the two and Fletcher fell over in the box.

My first instinct was that's a great show of strength. However, when I heard the referee blow the whistle I couldn't believe it. He gave a penalty! Not only that, Coloccini was sent off (for denying a goalscoring opportunity, even though Fletcher was running away from goal). Absolute nonsence in my opinion. It just goes to show that football is now a non contact sport. Players go down as soon as they are touched and the ref's quickly follow with awarding them a free kick.

A follow on point from this is that now, most fouls lead to a yellow card. The punishment for fouling someone is the awarding of a free kick to the opposing side. However, most fans seem to think now that the free kick should also be accompanied with a yellow card of the player who committed the foul. Yellow cards should only be shown for dangerous play, consistent fouling or professional fouling.

##2. 'Injured' Players

How many times in a game do we see players go down 'injured' and within a minute having received treatment from the physio, run back on the pitch and carry on perfectly fine? It happens consistently. It's a form of cheating.

Now referees have been instructed to only stop play when a player injures his head, they will hold their head in hope that the referee will stop the game (which they usually do).

To get rid of this, football should follow in the steps of rugby and continue the game and allow the physio's/medics to be able to run onto the pitch whenever a player goes down. This will allow the game to flow and will encourage players to stop feigning injury and get on with it.

It also annoys me when the team with possesion kicks the ball out for the opposition also. They should continue playing. It's up to the referee to stop the game. Don't kick the ball out for the sake of 'good sportsmanship'. Your job is to win the game and you should take advantage of the situation.

##3. Players Being Afraid To Make Mistakes

I'm sure stats play on footballers minds too much nowadays. I think every player wants to get a 95% pass success rate. In doing so, you will see plenty of backwards and sideways 5 yard passes. No longer do midfielders try 30 yard passes across the field, or a through pass to try and split the defence as they are afraid of giving away possesion and ruining their pass ratio.

I've also noticed wingers try less and less to beat the full back and make a cross (especially if it means they have to use their weaker foot). Instead, they'll cut back in and make the simple pass to the defender.

I think this has a lot to do with managers telling their players to keep possesion. Most teams are now trying to play like Barcelona, playing it out from the back. They'll pass it along the back of defence until they eventually get to the final third of the pitch where they run out of ideas and can't get a shot on goal.

Football is a game of mistakes. You have to try things to make things happen, and in doing so mistakes will be made, which may lead to the opposition scoring. However, if you get two teams attacking, not afraid to make mistakes, you will get a much more entertaining game of football than two cautious teams who will have plenty of possesion but not trying to do anything with it.

##4. The Price of Football

There's too much money involved with football now. The team finishing last of the Premier League will receive over £60 million. However, ticket prices continue to rise! You would think the clubs could pass on some of this money to reduce ticket prices and help fans spend less. Obviously not. As long as fans keep purchasing tickets they don't care.

I think the [FSF's Twenty's Plenty](http://fsf.org.uk/campaigns/away-fans/twentys-plenty/) campaign is a fine example of where clubs could use the TV revenue to help fans. Away days are expensive when you take into consideration the cost of the ticket, travel, food (and beer if you're an adult) for the day. Especially if there's a family going, which would cost even more. £20 is more than enough to charge an away fan for a ticket. If away fans stop attending games, the atmosphere would diminish, meaning it would be less entertaining for a TV audience, leading to a loss in viewership, and in turn a loss in advertising and TV revenue for the clubs. This may be something for the big wigs of clubs to think about before it's too late and the bubble bursts.

##5. Goalkeepers Swapping Sides for a Goal Kick

This is just a pet peeve of mine and I think it should be stopped. Goalkeepers that swap sides to take a goal kick. This is one of the biggest tactics to waste time and nothing gets done to stop it. A goal kick should be taken on the side of the box where the ball has gone out of play. It's a simple as that. This would stop so much time wasting of watching a goalkeeper trot from one side of his 18 yard box to another to take a goal kick.
