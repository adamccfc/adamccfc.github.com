I had been contemplating making the switch from Wordpress to Jekyll for a while. There were a number of reasons from doing this, and I would encourge any other blogger/deverloper to consider taking the plunge themselves.

## Benefits of Jekyll

Jekyll has a number of benefits that make it a superior platform to use compared to Wordpress. They include:

#### Speed

Jekyll blogs are all static HTML which means that the speed of the website is very fast. Most Wordpress sites seem to be slow which is not great for the user experience.

#### Hosting

You can host your Jekyll blog through Github Pages which means you do not have to pay for hosting. It also means that if you are proficient with Git then it's easy to update the website. Wordpress however, you must pay for hosting as well as a database to store all the data. So if you're on a tight budget, Jekyll is definitely for you.

#### Maintenance

Jekyll sites are just static files hosted on a server, so you do not need to spend time maintaining them. Wordpress on the other hand needs updating constantly, along with plugins and themes. If you don't have time to do these updates then Wordpress can become prone to hacks. This leads on to the next point.

#### Security

Due to the fact that a Jekyll blog is static files hosted on a server, there is nothing that can be exploited. Where as Wordpress has become susceptible to people hacking websites and bringing them down completely.
