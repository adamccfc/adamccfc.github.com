## About The Project

The Complete Morocco website was built using an old version of Holistic. It was very slow, the design was outdated and it was hard for the user to navigate around the site to find the information they were looking for. The main thing I wanted to accomplish with this website, was to allow give the user a positive experience whilst using the website to get to the information they were looking for in a quick and easy manner. 

## Technologies Used

The new website has been built using Eysys' custom CMS called Holistic and their own front end framework called Highwayman. 

Below is a list of the technologies that have been used to create this website:

- Handlebars
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Grunt
- Bower
- NPM

## Outcome

Below is a preview of the homepage of the Complete Morocco website.

## Conclusion

So yesterday the website was launched at [www.completemorocco.com](http://www.completemorocco.com). I'm proud of the fact that this site has been designed and built by myself, whilst getting some advice and help from colleagues along the way.
