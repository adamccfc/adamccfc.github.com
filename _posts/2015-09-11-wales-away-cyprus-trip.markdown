It's been nearly 10 months since my last away trip with Wales, when 12 of us set off to Brussels to watch the team get a cracking draw away to the team ranked second in the world.

This time it was a much further joruney to watch my beloved country try and kick on their campaign to qualify for a major tournament for the first time in 58 years. Cyprus was the destination. Three of my mates and I decided to take the 4 and a half hour flight to Larnaca to continue to support Wales.

We landed the day before the game and joined up with hundreds, if not thousands of Welsh fans in the square bar for a pre match celebration, knowing if we beat Cyprus we would be one win away from qualification. The party went on into the early hours of the night with fans from all over Wales coming together in support of their national team. There were no signs of tensions between the different groups of club fans, cemented to me by sharing a few jager bombs with a Swansea fan I had met that night. 

### Match Day

The day had finally come. I'd been waiting 7 months for this since we had booked to go. We started the day with the only option. Taking full advantage of our all inclusive package and spending the day by the bar. We stayed there and had a few until around 3pm, before we headed to the ilusive square bar. We got there and you could sense the party atmosphere. The square was a sea of red with the odd dash of yellow and green. Flags were drapped all around and the beer was free flowing.

It wasn't long before the chants were being sung aloud. Wales have previously struggled to create songs in the past, but this campaign has been completely different. With the breakthrough of the 'Don't Take Me Home' and 'Zombie Nation' chants that were born in Brussels, along with the 'Ohhh Hal Robson Kanu' and 'Viva Gareth Bale', (plus many more), we now have a large range of songs that fans can sing to get behind the team with. There was a great atmosphere for what was to hopefully to follow with a great game of football!

### The Match

The match itself turned out to be a bit of a dissapointment. The Cypriots defended well and pressed Wales high. It took something special from the talisman Bale again to help Wales take victory. Jazz Richards put in a fantastic cross and Bale finished with a stunning header! I'm not trying to be a match reporter so if you want to read a write up about the game itself you can do so [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/cyprus-vs-wales-match-report-gareth-bales-bullet-header-has-welsh-on-brink-of-euro-2016-10485586.html).

### After The Game

We were all in a complete frenzy after the game. We knew that it would now only take one more win to reach qualification with 3 games left to play. The fans partied into the early hours of the morning in Ayia Napa in the square bar with lots of chanting and dancing to our favourite songs! This was another trip to remember, and though I don't think it topped the Brussels trip it will still be one to remember!
