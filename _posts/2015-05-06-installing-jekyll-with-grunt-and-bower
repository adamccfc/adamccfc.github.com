I wanted to try creating my own portfolio website by using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for a long time. I found it simple to install, but to change the layout and design of the website I thought it would be worthwhile using [Bower](http://bower.io/) to install any libraries/frameworks and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to help compile everything that I would want to build my website with.

Now, I was wondering the best way to go about this, and after a quick search, I came across a tutorial that I found very helpful. It was written by Patrick Pletscher, and you can check his post out [here](http://www.pletscher.org/blog/2013/05/27/website.html). My post is based on his tutorial, but whilst following it, there were some changes that I made to get it to work the way I wanted it to.

# Installing Jekyll

The first thing you will need to do, that Patrick's post does not cover is installing a Jekyll instance. I won't go into much detail on this, but you can follow the Jekyll tutorial [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on how to get everything set up and installed correctly.
