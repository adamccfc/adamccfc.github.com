At the beginning of December we found out who Wales would be facing at a major tournament for the first time since 1958. They were Slovakia, Russia and of course England. It was bound to happen, wasn't it?!

Of course, Wales were to be drawn in the group that required fans to travel the most distance over the group stage, a colossal 1,543km. So the planning of this epic journey ahead of my friends, farther and I was to be a great undertaking.

Wales are set to play their first game in Bordeaux against Slovakia, in the South East of France. Then they will play England in Lens in the North of France. Finally, Welsh fans will need to travel back down to the South of France to watch them take on Russia in Toulouse. The map below shows the stadiums where Wales will be playing and it echoes what an effort it will take from Welsh fans to get to all three games.

## Our Plan

I'll leave dates and prices out of the plan, but I thought I'd write our travel plan if anyone else needed help to organise their own trip.

### Days 1 - 4

We will set off from Mountain Ash and make a few hours drive to Bristol airport. From Bristol we will fly to Beziers which is about a 2 hour flight away. We got these flights for a decent price, but just to note that they do not fly to this destination every day so take this into consideration. After landing in Beziers we will have to travel about 2 hours to get to Toulouse where we are staying in France for the first 4 nights.

The reason we decided to stay in Toulouse for the first 4 nights was due to the fact that we couldn't get any accommodation that was affordable in Bordeaux where the first game is taking place. So when Wales play their first game, we will need to travel to Bordeaux and back to Toulouse. This isn't idea, but was a solution to not being able to stay in Bordeaux.

### Days 4 - 7

We don't have any travel plans yet for how we're going to get around France, but we're looking at mainly using the rail system. So on day 4 we need to get from Toulouse to Lille where we will be staying for 3 nights. The reason for deciding to stay in Lille was down to the game being played in Lens. There was not much accommodation available in Lens, so with Lille being only half hour away by train we thought this would be a good option.

### Days 7 - 8

After our stay in Lille we will be heading back down to the South of France for the final game. To break things up a bit we found a very cheap hostel in Bourges (which is in the middle of France) where we will be staying for a night. This meant that we would not have to do such a long trip from the North to the South in one day.

### Days 8 - 11

Our last leg of the trip will see us returning to Toulouse where the final game is taking place. This will be the first time we will not have to travel far to get to the game so hopefully we will be able to celebrate Wales getting through to the knockout stages of the tournament.

On the final day then to get home, we will travel back to Beziers from Toulouse and fly back to Bristol.
